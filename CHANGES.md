Yoyak changelog
===============

Version 0.3.0
-------------

To be released.

 -  Added `-u`/`--user-agent` option to `yoyak scrape` and `yoyak summary`
    commands to specify a custom `User-Agent` string.

 -  Yoyak now can be identified through its unique `User-Agent` string.  The
    `User-Agent` string is `Yoyak/0.3.0` followed by the version of Deno, e.g.,
